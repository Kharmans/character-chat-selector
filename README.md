Overview
Character Chat Selector is a Foundry VTT module that enhances the chat interface by adding a convenient character selector and customizable chat portraits. It allows players and GMs to easily switch between different characters when chatting, even without tokens on the scene. The module enables speaking as both characters and tokens, functioning correctly regardless of token presence.
